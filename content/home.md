	Hello there!
	
		<div>
My name is Kai and Iâ€™m currently a college student interested in Mathematics and   Statistics. In my free time, I love to hike, listen to music by either John         Williams or Joe Hisaishi, and play League of Legends. 

I plan on using this blog as a means to document my work and share my thoughts.
