*Hello there!*

My name is Kai and I'm currently a college student interested in Mathematics and Statistics. In my free time, I love to hike, listen to music by either John Williams or Joe Hisaishi, and play League of Legends. I plan on using this blog as a means to document my work and share my thoughts.
